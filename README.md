# SonarQube-Community
This repo contains information about installing and running the SonarQube community edition, which is free software for static code analysis.
I will show how to configure this application using a docker image. The setup consists of two parts:
  1. Configuring the SonarQube server which is the main application and contains all the necessary components.
  2. The second one is the sonar scanner CLI which is used to communicate with the server. One can use this scanner to scan the code base.
